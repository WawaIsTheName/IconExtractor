Windows 7+ required

Python 3.6+ required

⚠️ If you plan on using this please note that you will need to install Python. It's pretty simple to use as long as you've used a console atleast once in your life. Also, this program isn't as capable as you might think, as it is very small to other complex libraries. some actions you do using this program may not output or extract exactly how you want them to because it is limited on some things and can sometimes be picky about what it can do!

❗It is recommended to run this via CMD in the program directory by using ```python ImageConstract.py```. If you run this by double clicking it, it may behave in a way that is hard to understand.

If you don't have much storage it'd to be recommended that you gain some incase the file you want to extract icon's from doesnt contain any because it will dumb a lot of system icon's!

Do as much as you'd like with this as I don't fully know whether it wont have errors for some people, With that said; this was basically manually made without any external libraries that other people have made on the internet since I didn't know or find any that I'd want to use. So don't expect a lot of on the spot compatibility!

If you are going out of your way to read the code of this I would recommend preparing your brain for reading such inconsistent, messy, hard to read, and probably really weird code for Python. While I started in python, I'm still very bad with it structurely and making it readable.
