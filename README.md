# IconExtractor
I made this because I couldn't find a good I could use.

Windows 7+ required
Python 3.6+ required

⚠️ If you plan on using this please note that you will need to install Python. It's pretty simple to use as long as you've used a console atleast once in your life.

If you don't have much storage it'd to be recommended that you gain some incase the file you want to extract icon's from doesnt contain any!

When the file you provide doesn't contain any icon's, the extractor will output almost every system icon it found on your system from the dll's located in System32 and SysWOW32/64. ⚠️ IF YOU HAVE YOUR SYSTEM FILES ON A SSD OTHER THAN C: YOU NEED TO EDIT THE CODE YOURSELF TO CHANGE IT TO THE SPECIFIED SSD.

Do as much as you'd like with this as I don't fully know whether it wont have errors for some people. If it does i'd recommend doing some research via ChatGPT or some other forum that provides help on errors if you don't know how to fix them because I won't always be able to help. With that said; this was basically manually made without any external libraries that other people have made on the internet since I didn't know or find any that I'd want to use.
