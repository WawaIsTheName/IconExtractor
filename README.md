# IconExtractor
I made this because I couldn't find a good I could use.

Windows 7+ required

Python 3.6+ required

⚠️ If you plan on using this please note that you will need to install Python. It's pretty simple to use as long as you've used a console atleast once in your life.

If you don't have much storage it'd to be recommended that you gain some incase the file you want to extract icon's from doesnt contain any because it will dumb a lot of system icon's!

Do as much as you'd like with this as I don't fully know whether it wont have errors for some people, With that said; this was basically manually made without any external libraries that other people have made on the internet since I didn't know or find any that I'd want to use. So don't expect a lot of on the spot compatibility!
